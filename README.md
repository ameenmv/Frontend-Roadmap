<h1 align="center">CIS Frontend Roadmap: Developer Learning Path</h1>

This is a curated roadmap to becoming a professional Front-end Developer that anyone could use to learn about the practice of front-end development.

<br/>

## 1. Basics

### A. Introduction

Front-end development involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a client-side application. The client-side of an online application is the visual part of a web application and also what a user interacts with when an application is opened: colours, fonts, buttons, navigations, animations, etc.

[📹 Watch: What's Front-End?](https://youtu.be/WG5ikvJ2TKA?si=Pphst6Y_xQBNuOJb) &nbsp; ![Recommended](https://badgen.net/badge/Recommended/PR/blue)

Front-end development includes the user interface of an application. Everything a user interacts with when a user visits a website such as a login or sign-up page, homepage, contact page falls under the front-end development term.

A front-end developer is responsible for building and implementing the interface of a website or web application. They build client-side applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In 2021 however, front-end development has gone beyond HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are a lot of web technologies you need to learn to be able to excel as a front-end developer this year.

## Git - Version Control

Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their projects and collaborate with teams. It ensures that there are no code conflicts between contributors, making it a must-have tool in any development environment.

## GitHub

GitHub is a code-hosting platform that allows teams to collaborate on software projects and use Git for version control. With GitHub, teams can create centralized repositories where each member can contribute, manage code, and maintain version history.

### B. HTML

HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language** and is the standard language for creating web pages. It is used to structure content and provide meaning to web elements like text, images, and multimedia. With HTML, developers can create accessible, responsive, and visually appealing websites.

HTML employs a series of tags to define a web page's structure and layout. For instance, the `<html>` tag marks the beginning and end of an HTML document, while the `<head>` and `<body>` tags define the document's structure.

<br/>

<br/>

### C. CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a fundamental technology used for web design. It is used to define the style, layout, and formatting of HTML documents. With CSS, developers can separate the presentation of a web page from the content, which makes it easier to design and maintain websites. CSS is used to control the layout of multiple web pages all at once, making it a powerful tool for web designers.

## 2. Intermediate

### A.Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a popular open-source CSS framework that provides pre-designed web elements and components for developers to use in their web projects. It was originally developed by Twitter and is now maintained by a community of developers. Bootstrap is designed to make it easy for developers to create responsive and mobile-first websites quickly and efficiently. It includes a wide range of pre-built CSS classes, JavaScript plugins, and other tools that can be used to create attractive and functional web interfaces without having to write much custom code.

### B. JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level programming language used to create interactive and dynamic websites. It is a scripting language that is used to create and control dynamic web content, such as animations and interactive forms. JavaScript is an essential component of modern web development and is supported by all major web browsers. It is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and responsive websites and web applications.

### D. SASS

<br/>

## What is SASS?

> - **Sass** stands for **S**yntactically **A**wesome **S**tyle**s**heet
> - Sass is an extension to CSS
> - Sass is a CSS pre-processor
> - Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
> - Sass reduces the repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
> - Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006

<br/>

## Why to use SASS?

> - Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.
> - Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff

<br/>

## **How Does Sass Work?**

> - A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS.
> - This process is called transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of program) some Sass code and then get some CSS code back.

### F. NPM & Webpack

## What is NPM?

> npm is the world's largest software registry. Open-source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

## Tutorial

> - Traversy Media [NPM Crash Course](https://youtu.be/jHDhaSSKmB0?si=SIZj4D5QXvc5R4xC)

## What is Webpack?

> Webpack is a **static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications**. It is an open-source tool that runs on top of NodeJS. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates one or more bundles that represent those modules. Webpack creates a dependency graph that maps every module your project needs and how they relate to each other.

## 3. Advanced Level

## JavaScript Libraries 📚✨

A JavaScript library is a collection of pre-written JavaScript code that simplifies development.

> 💡 _Search about what you want, and you will find a library to do it._

## Module Bundlers

A JavaScript module bundler compiles small pieces of code (aka modules) into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application.

## JavaScript Frameworks

In this section, you will learn about **JavaScript Frameworks**, **JavaScript State Management**, and **Server-side Rendering**.

### JavaScript Frameworks:

JavaScript frameworks are tools designed to speed up development and organize code used to build modern web apps. They exist to solve problems more directly rather than providing an open set of tools like most libraries do. Many modern companies use frameworks as a standard part of their tooling, so many front-end development jobs require framework experience.

### JavaScript State Management:

State Management helps in updating the UI in related places when there is a change in the application data due to actions performed in the application like clicks, hovers, etc. It also ensures that state changes have been incorporated at corresponding places.

### Server-side Rendering:

Server-side rendering (SSR) is the ability of an application to contribute by displaying the web page on the server instead of rendering it in the browser. The server-side sends a fully rendered page to the client; the client's JavaScript bundle takes over, allowing the Vue.js app to hydrate.

---

### Top 3 JavaScript Frameworks:

- **[Vue](https://vuejs.org/)**
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**
- **[Angular](https://angular.io/)**
